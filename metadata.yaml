description: The "Acres of Diamonds" speech was reportedly delivered nearly 6,000
  times. The central theme of the motivational message was that wealth and prosperity
  exist everywhere, but it is up to the listener to find it. The extended metaphor
  of a man's home above a diamond mine is carried throughout. Robert Shackleton has
  accompanied the speech with a biography and several essays on Russell Conwell's
  achievements.
